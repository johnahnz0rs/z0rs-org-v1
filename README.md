#johnahnz0rs to-do

[] change contact form method from formspree to custom backend

[x] reformat contactinfo.js to list-unstyled, no caption, & center all
[x] add padding to contactform.js bc the edges are over the edge -- i added .container to the form.js and it seems to have fixed this issue
[x] about.js - add video-placeholder and notes
[x] resume.js - add img-placeholder and notes
[x] portfolio.js - test div-row w/ cols - staying with original table layout
[] contentarea.js - navbar
